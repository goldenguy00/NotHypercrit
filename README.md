# Hypercrit 2: The Critening

This is a rewrite/continuation of [Hypercrit by Thinkinvis](https://thunderstore.io/package/ThinkInvis/Hypercrit/). The code is under GPL3, since the original was.

Adds a highly configurable crit-stacking mechanic which gives an effect to crit chance past 100%.

## Changes from the original

- Proc config: "On-crit" effects apply multiple times on Hypercrit. Configurable.
- [BetterUI](https://thunderstore.io/package/XoXFaby/BetterUI/) support: adds `$hypercrit` that shows total current damage multiplier.
- [Moonglasses](https://thunderstore.io/package/TheMysticSword/MysticsItems/) rework: Instead of halving Crit chance, reduces it by -100% (Configurable) to be more impactful.
